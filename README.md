# Project-Euler
Will trying to solve Project-Euler with elixir-lang and C-lang, comparing execution time, not optimising, just how i thought the solution.

Problem 1 
Elixir-> 85 microseconds (0.000 085 seconds)
C ->  7 microseconds(0.000 007 seconds)

Problem 2
Elixir -> 3 microseconds (0.000 003 seconds)
C -> 1 microseconds (0.000 001 seconds)

Problem 3
Elixir -> 496 microseconds (0.000 496 seconds)
C -> 84 microseconds (0.000 084 seconds)

Problem 4
C-> 19075 microseconds (0.019075 seconds)
